# React Movie DB

Welcome to the React Movie DB project! This is my practice project, in this project, I built a React app using OMDB API https://www.omdbapi.com/.

## Live Site

You can see the live site at:  
<https://movie-omdb-api.vercel.app/>

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/wisnust/movie-omdb-api.git
```

2.  Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3.  Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

The app will open in your default browser at <http://localhost:8888>.
You can make changes to the code and the page will automatically reload
with your changes.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite, use the command:

```
npm test
```

This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.

## Ejecting

If you need to eject the app from the current configuration, you can use
the command:

```
npm run eject
```

This is a one-way operation and cannot be undone.
